# Spotify Album Collage

A program that creates an image collage from album covers.

I came up with this idea when I wanted an album collage as my desktop wallpaper. Kind of similar to when I had songs on iTunes (before I jumped on the Spotify train in 2012) and it would create a screen saver of all the albums.

### Future Features

- collage based on colors
  - so if user selects a particular color it will make all the images feature that color primarily so the entire collage will be primary that color as well
